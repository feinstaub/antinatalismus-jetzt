* Besser die Sache im Hier und Jetzt selber in die Hand nehmen,
    als die Probleme liegen zu lassen und die Verantwortung einfach weiterzugeben.
    Vergleiche "GlÃ¼ckspiel mit dem Leben"-Argument.
* Was auch mÃ¶glich ist: Das Kind kÃ¶nnte spÃ¤ter der nÃ¤chste Diktator werden.

    * Beispiel: Adoption.
    * Beispiel: Bildungsarbeit an Schulen etc.
